// Cover Letter

1. Intro
2. Experience/context for the resume
3. Related back to the role
4. Sign off/signature

Should show off your background and why it's relevant for the job. Who are you, where do you go to school, what have you done. What are your experiences for the job. Relate that back to the role.

Do research on the role. Make it personal. No more than one page. Triple check your "easy info" (name, email) and proofread. 

// Resume Structure

Make sure they're up to date and hyperlinks
- Name
- Contact info
- LinkedIn
- GitHub, DevPost, personal website (some personal repository of your work)

Don't put soft skills you don't have since they'll find if they're true in interviews
- Outline technical (platforms, languages, and rank them) and soft skills

Employment experience, projects, and education are interchangeable (i.e. in any order). 

Employment experience
- Reverse chronological order (even if it's not as relevant)
- STAR statements
- Highlight skills used (tech & non-tech)

Projects
- Personal, hackathons, school
- Highlight skills and programming languages used
- Relate these to the positions you're applying for

Education
- School + program name
- Relevant courses
- Graduation date

Extra curriculars / Volunteering
- 1-2 bullet points
- Showcase your soft skills / passions / interests / stuff outside of tech skills

// STAR Method (1-2 bullet points)

"How do I showcase my accomplishments?" (once you showed what your position was)

Situation: What did you do or where did you work 

Task: Your key objective (over the course of that period of time, what was the main thing you/your team was trying to accomplish)

Action: Describe the action you took or initiated, including skills you used (take ownership of the work you've done; use "I" statements)

Result: Outcome of your actions (try to quantify the outcome)

// Resume Do's

- Have the job description in front of you and read through it thoroughly (drop the keywords into your resume where you can; copy and paste keywords)
- Compare the must-haves with your skillset and experiences (they really are looking for these skills)
- Always have a Skills Summary section and list down the points which pertain to you
- Focus both on soft skills and technical skills
- Save resume in PDF as "firstName lastName - Job ID (or title)"
- Projects, courswork, and volunteer work are also applicable
- Describe accomplishments, not duties - STAR method
- Ensure proper spelling, grammar and formatting is consistent
- Include links to your work. Ex. LinkedIn, GitHub, personal portfolio

// Resume Don't's

- Don't need an objective statement
- Don't address your cover letter and resume to another company
- Don't apply with the same resume to different jobs - make sure to tailor your resume to each job you apply to (create 2-3 types of resumes that're tailored differently for each one; change up the keywords + projects)
- Don't have too many graphics or colours

// After you click submit

- Interact with recruiters/hiring managers
- Don't reach out until after you applied for the job
- Don't do completely blind messages, take a second to build a relationship, talk about something you have in common
- To prep for your interview, do your research on the role and the company, have a list of interview questions (what qualities have you not seen in other interviewees that you are still looking for? what do you want to see me accomplish in the first 30 days vs. the first 60 days?)
- Be yourself, make a good first-impression
- Ask for help when you need it
- Have some questions ready

// Stuff to change for my own resume

- May not need to put dates for your projects (not as helpful as it may seem)
- Include some soft skills
- Resume doesn't have to be one page since now they're not printing it
